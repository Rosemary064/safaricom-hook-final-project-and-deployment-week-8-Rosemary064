## Food Ordering Webpage â€“ Documentation
The Food Ordering Webpage is a responsive multipage website designed to streamline the process of ordering food online. The website consists of three main pages: Home, About, and Contact, each providing essential information and functionality for users.

## Design Choices
The website features a modern and minimalistic design using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. A warm color palette (red, orange, and white) was chosen to create a welcoming and appetizing visual appeal. The layout follows a structured format, including a navigation bar, featured food sections, and a contact form, ensuring easy accessibility.

## Features Implemented
## JavaScript Functionality:
A dynamic food menu that filters items based on categories.
Form validation on the Contact page to ensure correct user inputs.
Interactive buttons for adding items to the cart.
## Responsive Design:
CSS media queries make the website fully functional across devices (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
Animations and hover effects enhance the user experience.
## Challenges & Solutions
Implementing a smooth checkout process required handling JavaScript event listeners effectively.
Ensuring the website remained responsive across screen sizes involved fine-tuning CSS grid and flexbox layouts.
## Deployment Process
The website was deployed on Netlify, with code hosted on GitHub for version control and future updates.
